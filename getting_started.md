# Getting Started

A great way to learn about EMOD is running an example.  You can learn:
- How to run
- How to configure
- How to run parameter sweeps
- How things are modeled in EMOD by reviewing the results

The easiest way to do this is by using GitHub Codespaces.  This will allow
you to run EMOD without installing it on your own computer.  However,
it does require a GitHub account.

- [Starting Codespaces](tutorial_starting_codespaces.md)
- [Run a simple example simulation](tutorial_run_simple_example.md)
- [Interpreting the results](tutorial_interpret_results.md)

Another way to learn about EMOD is through the
[documentation](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emodpy-malaria/en/latest/emod/software-overview.html).
It provides lots of information on how EMOD models malaria as well as how malaria
works.
