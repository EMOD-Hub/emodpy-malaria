        Adds scheduled IRSHousingModification intervention to the campaign. The IRSHousingModification intervention class
        includes Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) in the simulation. IRS is another key vector control tool in which
        insecticide is sprayed on the interior walls of a house so that mosquitoes resting on the walls after
        consuming a blood meal will die. IRS can also have a repellent effect. Because this class is distributed
        to individuals, it can target subgroups of the population. To target all individuals in a node, use
        IndoorSpaceSpraying. Do not use IRSHousingModification and IndoorSpaceSpraying together.

        start_day: The day the intervention is given out.

            receive the intervention. It does not guarantee that the exact fraction of the target population set by

            the intervention repeats forever. Sets **Number_Repetitions**
        timesteps_between_repetitions: The interval, in timesteps, between repetitions. Ignored if repetitions = 1.
            Sets **Timesteps_Between_Repetitions**
