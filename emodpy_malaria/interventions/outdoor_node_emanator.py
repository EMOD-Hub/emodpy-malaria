        Configures OutdoorNodeEmanator intervention.

        Note: for killing and repelling effects - depending on the parameters you set,
        different WaningEffect classes will be used:
        box_duration = -1 => WaningEffectConstant, decay_time_constant is ignored
        box_duration = 0 + decay_time_constant > 0 => WaningEffectExponential
        box_duration > 0 + decay_time_constant = 0 => WaningEffectBox
        box_duration > 0 + decay_time_constant > 0 => WaningEffectBoxExponential


    Args:
        campaign:
        killing_initial_effect: Initial strength of the Killing effect. The effect may decay over time.
        killing_box_duration: Box duration of effect in days before the decay of Killing Initial_Effect.
        killing_decay_time_constant: The exponential decay length, in days of the Killing Initial_Effect.
        repelling_initial_effect: Initial strength of the Repelling effect. The effect may decay over time.
        repelling_box_duration: Box duration of effect in days before the decay of Repelling Initial_Effect.
        repelling_decay_time_constant: The exponential decay length, in days of the Repelling Initial_Effect.
        spray_coverage: The proportion of the node affected. This value is multiplied by the current efficacy of the
            waning effects.
        insecticide: The name of the insecticide defined in config.Insecticides for this intervention.
            If insecticides are being used, then this must be defined as one of those values.  If they are not
            being used, then this does not needed to be specified or can be empty string.  It cannot have a
            value if config.Insecticides does not define anything.
        cost: Unit cost per OutdoorNodeEmanator
        new_property_value: New NodeProperty value to assign to individuals receiving this intervention. Must be
            in format of "PropertyName:Value", e.g. "EmanatorNode:Yes".
        intervention_name: The optional name used to refer to this intervention as a means to differentiate it from
            others that use the same class.
