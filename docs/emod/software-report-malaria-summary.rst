MalariaSummaryReport
====================

The malaria summary report (MalariaSummaryReport.json) is a JSON-formatted report that provides a
population-level summary of malaria data grouped into different bins such as age, parasitemia, gametocyte density, and
infectiousness.



Configuration
=============

To generate this report, the following parameters must be configured in the custom_reports.json file:

.. csv-table::
    :header: Parameter, Data type, Min, Max, Default, Description
    :widths: 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 20

    **Filename_Suffix**, string, NA, NA, (empty string), "Augments the filename of the report. If multiple reports are being generated, this allows you to distinguish among the multiple reports."
    **Start_Day**,"float","0","3.40282e+38","0","The day of the simulation to start collecting data."
    **End_Day**,"float","0","3.40282e+38","3.40282e+38","The day of the simulation to stop collecting data."
    **Node_IDs_Of_Interest**,"array of integers","0","2.14748e+09","[]","Data will be collected for the nodes in this list.  Empty list implies all nodes."
    **Must_Have_IP_Key_Value**, string, NA, NA, (empty string), "A Key:Value pair that the individual must have in order to be included. Empty string means to not include IPs in the selection criteria."
    **Must_Have_Intervention**, string, NA, NA, (empty string), "The name of the intervention that the person must have in order to be included. Empty string means to not include interventions in the selection criteria."
    **Reporting_Interval**, integer, 1, 1000000, 1000000, "Defines the cadence of the report by specifying how many time steps to collect data before writing to the file. This will limit system memory usage and is advised when large output files are expected."
    **Max_Number_Reports**, integer, 0, 1000000, 1, The maximum number of report output files that will be produced for a given campaign per simulation.
    **Pretty_Format**, boolean, 0, 1, 0, "True (1) sets pretty JSON formatting. The default, false (0), saves space."

    **Individual_Property_Filter**, string, NA, NA, (empty string), "The individual 'property:value' to filter on. The default of an empty string means the report is not filtered. For example: 'Risk:High'."
    **Include_DataByTimeAndPfPRBinsAndAgeBins**, boolean, 0, 1, 1, "When set to true, the 'DataByTimeAndPfPRBinsAndAgeBins' element is included in the report.  Default is true.  You can save disk space by setting this to false."
    **Include_DataByTimeAndInfectiousnessBinsAndPfPRBinsAndAgeBins**, boolean, 0, 1, 0, "When set to true, the 'DataByTimeAndInfectiousnessBinsAndPfPRBinsAndAgeBins' element is included in the report.  Default is true.  You can save disk space by setting this to false."
    **Add_True_Density_Vs_Threshold**, boolean, 0, 1, 0, "If set to true, four new channels will be added to the report that use true density instead of measured.  These additional channels are: 'PfPR_2to10-True', 'PfPR by Age Bin-True', 'Pf Gametocyte Prevalence by Age Bin-True', and 'Mean Log Parasite Density by Age Bin-True'.

    **Add_Prevalence_By_HRP2**, boolean, 0, 1, 0, "If true, the 'PfPR_2to10-HRP2' and the 'PfPR by Age Bin-HRP2' channels will be added.  These channels will use 'Detection_Threshold_True_HRP2' to determine if person's HRP2 level counts towards prevalence."
    **Detection_Threshold_True_HRP2**, 0, 3.40282e+38, 0, "Used when 'Add_Prevalence_By_HRP2' is true.  If the true HRP2 value is greater than this threshold, the prevalence will be increased in the 'PfPR_2to10-HRP2' and the 'PfPR by Age Bin-HRP2' channels."
