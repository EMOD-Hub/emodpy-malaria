# Mortality and survival


The following parameter determine mortality and survival characteristics of the disease being modeled
and the population in general (non-disease mortality).

See [malaria-severe-mortality](#malaria-severe-mortality) for more information about how fever, anemia, and
parasite counts lead to severe malaria and mortality.


!!! note
    Parameters are case-sensitive. For Boolean parameters, set to 1 for true or 0 for false.
    Minimum, maximum, or default values of "NA" indicate that those values are not applicable for
    that parameter.

    EMOD does not use true defaults; that is, if the dependency relationships indicate that a parameter is required, you must supply a value for it. However, many of the tools used to work with EMOD will use the default values provided below.

    JSON format does not permit comments, but you can add "dummy" parameters to add contextual
    information to your files. Any keys that are not EMOD parameter names will be ignored by the
    model.
