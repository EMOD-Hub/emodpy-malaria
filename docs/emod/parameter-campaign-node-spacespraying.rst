SpaceSpraying
=============

The **SpaceSpraying** intervention class implements node-level vector control by spraying pesticides
outdoors. This intervention targets specific habitat types, and imposes a mortality rate on all
targeted (both immature and adult male and female) mosquitoes. All mosquitoes have daily mortality
rates; mortality for adult females due to spraying is independent of whether or not they are
feeding.

At a glance:

*  **Distributed to:** Nodes
*  **Serialized:** No. You need to redistribute when starting from a serialized file.
*  **Uses insecticides:** Yes. It can target sub-groups using genomes, especially if you want to target specific sexes.
*  **Time-based expiration:** No
*  **Purge existing:** Yes and No. Uses PurgeExistingByName(). Adding a new intervention of this class will overwrite any existing intervention of the same class and Intervention_Name, however, if Intervention_Name is different, both interventions will coexist and their efficacies will combine.
*  **Vector killing contributes to:** Die Without Attempting To Feed & Die Before Attempting Human Feed
*  **Vector effects:** Killing
*  **Vector sexes affected:** Males and females
*  **Vector life stage affected:** Adult and immature
