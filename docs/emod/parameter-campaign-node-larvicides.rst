==========
Larvicides
==========

The **Larvicides** intervention class is a node-level intervention that configures a killing effect for larva
in specific habitats. This intervention can be used to simulate the application of larvicides to water bodies.


At a glance:

*  **Distributed to:** Nodes
*  **Serialized:** No, it needs to be redistributed when starting from a serialized file.
*  **Uses insecticides:** Yes. The vector genome can be used to target specific genders.
*  **Time-based expiration:** No. It will continue to exist even if efficacy is zero.
*  **Purge existing:** No. Already existing intervention(s) of this class continue(s) to exist together with any new interventions of this class. Their efficacies combine 1-(1-prob1)*(1-prob2) etc.
*  **Vector killing contributes to:** Combines with competition and rainfall to kill larvae every time step.
*  **Vector effects:** Killing
*  **Vector sexes affected:** Both males and female larva
*  **Vector life stage affected:** Larval
