MultiInsecticideIRSHousingModification
======================================

The **MultiInsecticideIRSHousingModification** intervention class is an individual-level intervention
that builds on the :doc:`parameter-campaign-individual-irshousingmodification` class by enabling
the use of multiple insecticides. The killing efficacy of each insecticide can be specified. This class
uses Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), where insecticide is sprayed on the interior walls of houses such that
mosquitoes resting on the walls after consuming blood meals will die.

The effectiveness of the intervention is combined using the following equation:

Total efficacy = 1.0 – (1.0 – efficacy_1) * (1.0 – efficacy_2) * … * (1.0 – efficacy_n)


At a glance:
