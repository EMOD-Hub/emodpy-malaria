==================
BroadcastNodeEvent
==================


The **BroadcastNodeEvent** node intervention class broadcasts node events. This can be used with the
campaign class, :doc:`parameter-campaign-event-surveillanceeventcoordinator`, that can monitor and
listen for events received from **BroadcastNodeEvent** and then perform an action based on the
broadcasted event. You can also use this for the reporting of the broadcasted events by setting the
configuraton parameters, **Report_Node_Event_Recorder** and **Report_Surveillance_Event_Recorder**,
which listen to events to be recorded. You must use this coordinator class with listeners that are
operating on the same core. You can also use :doc:`parameter-campaign-node-nlhtivnode`.

For more information, see :doc:`emod:dev-architecture-core`.
