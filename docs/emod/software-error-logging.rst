Error and logging files
=======================

When you run a simulation, |EMOD_s| will output basic error and logging information to help track
the progress and help debug any issues that may occur. If you run the simulation on an HPC
cluster, the cluster will generate additional logging and error files. See :doc:`troubleshooting`
if you need help resolving an error.

Status
======

A status.txt file will be saved to the :term:`working directory` that provides one
output line per time step and includes the total run time of the simulation. A simulation
with 50 time steps will look something like this::

Standard output
===============

When you run a simulation on an HPC cluster, it will generate a standard output logging file
(StdOut.txt) in the working directory that captures all standard output messages. When you run a
simulation locally, the Command Prompt window will display the same information. If you want to save
this information to a text file instead, you can append ``> stdout.txt`` to the command used to
run the local |EMOD_s| simulation to redirect the console output to the file specified.

The file contains information about a particular simulation, such as the |EMOD_s| version used and
the files in use, as well as other initialization information, including the default logging level
and the logging levels set for particular modules. The file follows that information
with log output using the following format: <timestep><HPC rank><log level><module><message>.

By default, the logging level is set to "INFO". If you want to change the logging level, see :doc:`emod:dev-logging`.

Standard error
==============

When you run a simulation on an HPC cluster, it will also generate a standard error logging file
(StdErr.txt) in the working directory that captures all standard error messages.
