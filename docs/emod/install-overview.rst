=====================
Install |EMOD_s| 
=====================


|EMOD_l| can be installed on computers running Windows (|Windows_supp|) or Linux (|Centos_supp|). For either operating
system, there are relatively few prerequisites required and the |exe_l| or |linux_binary| is 
pre-built from the latest |EMOD_s| source code release. After completing installation, you can run
simulations locally or on an HPC cluster using real-world data.
 
If you want to download and modify the |EMOD_s| source code and build the |exe_s| or |linux_binary|
yourself, see :doc:`emod:dev-install-overview`.
