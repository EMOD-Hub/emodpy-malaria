============================
Install |EMOD_s| on Windows
============================

To install |EMOD_s| on Windows computers, follow the steps below. You will install the pre-built
|exe_s| and all software necessary to run simulations locally.  Optionally, you can
install Python virtual environments, software to plot the output of simulations, and |EMOD_s| 
:term:`input files` for various regions.

.. include:: ../reuse/testing-windows.txt

If you want to download and modify the |EMOD_s| source code and build the |exe_s|
yourself, see :doc:`emod:dev-install-overview`.

Install |EMOD_s|
================

.. include:: ../reuse/windows-install-to-run.txt

#.  On GitHub on the `EMOD releases`_ page, download the |exe_l|.  Save to a local drive, such as
    the desktop.

.. warning:: Double-clicking |exe_s| will not run the |EMOD_s| software or launch an installer. 
    You must run |EMOD_s| from the command line or a script. See :doc:`software-run-simulation` 
    for more information.

(Optional) Install plotting software
====================================

None of the following plotting software is required to run simulations with |EMOD_s|, but it
is useful for creating graphs from and evaluating the model output. In addition, |EMOD_s|
provides many Python scripts for analyzing data.
