IRSHousingModification
======================

The **IRSHousingModification** intervention class includes Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) in the
simulation. IRS is another key vector control tool in which insecticide is sprayed on the interior
walls of a house so that mosquitoes resting on the walls after consuming a blood meal will die. IRS
can also have a repellent effect. Because this class is distributed to individuals, it can target
subgroups of the population. To target all individuals in a node, use
:doc:`parameter-campaign-node-indoorspacespraying`. Do not use **IRSHousingModification** and
**IndoorSpaceSpraying** together.
